## How It's Made:
### Tech used: Jupyter Notebook, Python
### This experiment was conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Here, it focuses more on arrays and how to use the numpy library. The code was confusing at first. I tried different codes, researched about them, and more. Thankfully, I found a code that worked well, and it was safe to say it worked.

## Lessons Learned:
###  Personally, I think the second experiment was harder than the first one. I sometimes do not understand arrays, but I understand how powerful they can be used, so I'm trying to learn more about them and maybe be good at them in the future.
